# CachyOS Pantheon

The goal is to recreate a similar experience from [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) to [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/).

## Reasons behind this project

To be honest, I really like the visual experience provided by __elementary OS__ but since I've discovered __CachyOS__, keep living with the Ubuntu base just drives me nuts...

As __CachyOS__ provides a "no desktop" install option, I told myself that could be a good base to try to recreate the same visual experience of __elementary OS__ but with the [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) [optimized base](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos) from [CachyOS](https://github.com/CachyOS).

That way, I can combine the best from both worlds!

1. Inherit from the excellent work from the [CachyOS](https://github.com/CachyOS) team (__They are great guys too!__)
2. Enjoy the nice visual experience using Pantheon (_the visual stack used in [elementary OS](https://github.com/elementary)_)

## Thanks

I'd like to give huge thanks to the __CachyOS__ team for their help! Without them, this project would not exist.
